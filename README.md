# find-large-files
Can be used to weed out files over a certain size fairly quickly.

Fairly simple Windows batch file to find any files larger than size N and move them to a separate folder. In my case I used this to find PDF files that had more than 2 pages in it. The size variable might need some tweaking for specific use.
